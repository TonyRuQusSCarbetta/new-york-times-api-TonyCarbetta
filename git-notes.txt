To make a new branch:
git checkout -b <new-branch-name-goes-here>

To check which branch you are on:
git status

To add changes:
git add .

To commit changes:
git commit -m "write your message here"

To go back to master branch:
git checkout master

To get the latest version:
git pull

To merge branches:
git merge master
(for example if we are on a branch called Changes, we use git merge master & this will merge whatever is in master to Changes)
